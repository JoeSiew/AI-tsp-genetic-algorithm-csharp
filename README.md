## Problem Definition
A new textbook salesman is planning to visit his potential clients (colleges or universities)
located in eight major cities in Malaysia such as shown in the Table. He will set out from Kuala
Lumpur and would like to visit all the cities and return to Kuala Lumpur. 
He would like to save the overall traveling cost by driving in terms of petrol mileage and toll. 
Thus, The question he asked himself is: “what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin
city?”
